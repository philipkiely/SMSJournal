## SMSJournal Django Site

This project uses three apps: core, users, and journals. Core is solely responsible for the shared areas of the site, such as the index page and similar pages. Users includes everything for the creation, maintenance, and billing of users. Journals includes everything for operating the journals, including the API accessible to the AWS Lambda SMS Handler and the Google App Script.
